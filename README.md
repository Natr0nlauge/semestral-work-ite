# MATRIX-IO Format Converter

## Purpose of the Program

The MATRIX-IO Format Converter is a simple Python utility designed to convert matrices and vectors between multiple common formats.
It is planned to support conversion between **LaTeX**, **CSV**, and **JSON** representations.

This tool aims to simplify the process of transferring data between mathematical documents, programming environments, and structured data files.
For example, it allows users to import a LaTeX matrix directly into a Python script as a NumPy array, or export a NumPy array into LaTeX syntax for reports and papers.
